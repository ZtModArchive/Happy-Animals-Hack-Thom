- **Description:**
  - Keeps animal needs satisfied.
  - Automatically crates escaped animals.
  - Refills all food dishes when they're almost empty.
  - Makes poop disappear automatically, and it's scentless so animals won't complain about it.
  - Trash gets automatically removed.
  - Improved the automatic tank cleaning code.
  - This hack now also removes biome and (tank) space needs. And it makes animals comfortable on elevated paths.
  - Only works for newly place animals, not animals already present in your current zoos!
  - I used the latest version of animal.xml, included in ZT2 UC. I advice you to only use it if you have ZT2 UC installed.
  - I haven't fully tested the impact of this hack on the animal's behavior yet. I did some quick tests and at least pooping, peeing and birthing behavior seems all right (these are all behaviors that are influenced by biome).
